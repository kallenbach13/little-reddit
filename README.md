# ReddArt

### Created By Isak Kallenbach

#### Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, React

This is an app that dynamically pulls the top posts from various art-related subreddits from the Reddit API.

As an art-lover and frequent reddit user, I thought it would be cool to make a curated reddit app that a user can quickly browse through various art subreddits and check out all the different works.


## Instructions

The following commands are meant to be typed into the terminal at the app's directory.

##### 1. npm install

This will install all modules and dependencies needed to run the app.

##### 2. npm start

This should run the app and open a window in your default browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Future Goals

#### 1. I want to create a function that will switch to a default image if no media is available (this is priority number one).
#### 2. I want to be able to dynamically display the name of the current subreddit at the top of the PostsContainer Component.
#### 3. I want to make videos and galleries visible.

If you have any tips on how to go about achieving any of these goals or any suggestion on what I should change/add/remove, feel free to let me know.
